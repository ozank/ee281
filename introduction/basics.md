# Basics

##SI Prefixes
The most common ones you'll see in this course are:
- Mega (M) $$10^6$$
- Kilo (k) $$10^3$$
- Mili (m) $$10^{-3}$$
- Micro ($$\mu$$) $$10^{-6}$$
- Nano (n) $$10^{-9}$$
- Pico (p) $$10^{-12}$$


## Charge
The unit of charge is Columbs (C), which is equal to charge of $$6.24 10^{18}$$ electrons.

Charges cannot be created or destroyed, they are just transferred.

## Current
Current is the rate of charge flow ($$i=\frac{dq}{dt}$$). 1 A equals to 1 Coulomb/seconds.

## Voltage
Voltage is related to the strenght of the electric field. It is analogous to pressure in a hydraulic circuit.

! Voltage is always measured between two points, that is why it is also called potential difference.

$$v = \frac{dw}{dq}$$

Voltage is equal to rate of work done by unit charge.

### Analogy to Hydraulic System
- Voltage ~ Pressure
- Electric Current ~ Water Current
- Tap Resistance ~ Resistance

## Power
Power is the rate of energy (expending or absorbing), denoted by $$P$$:

$$P=\frac{dw}{dt}$$

In electric circuits power is equal to multiplication of voltage and current.

$$Power = Voltage \times Current$$
$$P = VI$$

The unit of power is **Watt**.

## Energy
Energy in the time integral of power. The unit of energy is Joules, which is equal to watt.seconds.

$$w=\int P(t) dt = \int V(t) I(t) dt$$

It is also common practice to express electrical energy in kilo-watt hours (**kWh**).

### Absorbing or Dissipating?

# Circuit Symbols
## Resistance
Limits the electric current. The unit is Ohm ($$\Omega$$)

$$Voltage = Current \times Resistance$$
$$V=IR$$

## Voltage Source
An ideal voltage source produces a voltage regardless of the current absorbed or produced by the device. Can be a battery, DC voltage source or AC voltage source.

A [lemon battery](http://hilaroad.com/camp/projects/lemon/lemon_battery.html) is also a DC voltage source (not an ideal one)

## Current Sources
An ideal current source produces the specified current regardless of the voltage across its terminals.
