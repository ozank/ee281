Hi! In this [website](https://www.gitbook.io/book/ozank/ee281),  [I](http://ozan.keysan.me/) will publish my personal course notes for 2nd year EE-281 Electric Circuits course (METU, 2014). For more information about the course, please visit the [official website]().

I'll try to update course notes every week. You can also contribute via [Github](https://github.com/ozank/ee281), if you want.
