# Analysis Methods

## A short review:
- **Kirchhoff's Current Law:** (Whatever comes in goes out: The net current in a closed surface is zero).
- **Kirchhoff's Voltage Law:** (The sum of voltages in a loop is zero).
- Definitions of **node, branches and loops**. (Mesh: a loop that does not enclose any other loops).

## Analysis Methods:
There are two methodical ways to analyze the electric circuits:
- **Nodal analysis** (Node Voltage Analysis)
- **Mesh analysis** (Mesh Current Analysis)

Although, these methods may seem difficult at first, you'll see it is the easieast and can be applied to even most complex circuits. These two techniques are so important that this section should be regarded as the most important in the course. Furthermore, in your professional life, you'll encounter so many cases where you have to represent a real world problem in terms of a linear matrix eqaution (which is the main idea behind the nodal and mesh analysis).
